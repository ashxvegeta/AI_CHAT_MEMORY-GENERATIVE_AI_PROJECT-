4. Integrate the AI assistant API: Connect the AI assistant to your e-commerce application by integrating its API. This allows the AI assistant to communicate with your application and access relevant data and services.

5. Test and optimize: Test the integration thoroughly to ensure that the AI assistant functions correctly and provides a seamless user experience. Continuously optimize the AI assistant based on user feedback and performance metrics.

6. Monitor and update: Monitor the performance of the AI assistant in your e-commerce application and regularly update it with new features, improvements, and training data to enhance its capabilities.
